# Data Engineering

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üè° [DBT Bootcamp: Airbnb rating data](https://github.com/jl-3586/dbtlearn) | March 2025 | DBT, Snowflake, SQL, Jinja, Git, Python | Developed a dbt project on Snowflake, focusing on building a robust ELT pipeline for Airbnb data. Applied advanced dbt techniques like orchestration, custom macros, and testing to ensure data integrity and quality. |
| üèéÔ∏è [MS Azure project: F1 racing data](https://github.com/jl-3586/fl_race) | July 2024 | Azure Databricks, ADLS, PySpark, SparkSQL, Power BI, Delta Lake, Azure Data Factory | Implemented a scalable ELT data pipeline in Microsoft Azure Cloud Ecosystem. Automated the ingestion, transformation, and reporting workflows. Created dashboards in Power BI and used Azure Data Factory for orchestration.|
| üôÖüèΩ [ETL pipeline: Government Violation Records](https://github.com/jl-3586/qf_cornellmps_fall23) | DEC 2023 | Python, Web Scraping, PyArrow, Docker, OCR | Designed and built an end-to-end pipeline to extract and process violation records from the public .gov website. Implemented web scraping on target wbesite, used OCR to convert PDF to text, and transformed data in parquet. Containerized the entire workflow using docker-compose for reproducibility.|

# ML & Analytics
| Project name | Completion Date | Area of Analysis | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ü©∫ Psychiatric Diagnostic prediction | Ongoing | LightGBM, SHAP, Feature Engineering, Multimodal Datasets | Developed a three-stage hierarchical classification using LightGBM to predict psychiatric disease diagnoses from multimodal datasets with 1K+ NLP features. Conducted extensive feature engineering to optimize model inputs and used SHAP analysis for enhanced interpretability of model decisions. |  
| üë©üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Clustering analysis for CKD Patients | May 2023 | EDA, data prepreprocessing, ML modeling, survival analysis | Analyzed more than 8M+ healthcare claim data for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Use random forest and survival analysis for feature selection, and applied Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering model that predicts the CKD progression which provided support to healthcare providers in providing personal level treatment|
