# Data Engineering

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| 🚗 [dbt Bootcamp: Airbnb rating data](https://github.com/jl-3586/dbtlearn) | March 2025 | dbt, Snowflake, SQL, Jinja, Git, Python | Developed and implemented a complete dbt project from scratch, focusing on building a robust data transformation ELT pipeline for Airbnb data. Set up the dbt project  in Snowflake. Leveraged dbt features such as models, materializations, seeds, and snapshots to create and optimize data pipelines. Applied advanced dbt techniques like orchestration, custom macros, and testing with dbt-expectations to ensure data integrity and quality. |

| [ETL pipeline: Government Violation Records](https://github.com/jl-3586/qf_cornellmps_fall23) | DEC 2023 | Python, Web Scraping, PyArrow, Docker, OCR | Built an ETL pipeline to extract and process violation data from the public gov website. Implemented web scraping for target websites, collecting metadata and saving structured outputs. Enhanced PDF processing using pdfplumber for text-based files and Tesseract OCR for scanned documents. Introduced Parquet output support via pyarrow, with standardized exports through a custom utility module. Containerized the entire workflow using Docker, enabling modular services for scraping and PDF parsing with configurable environment setups. |

# Data Science & Machine learning

| Project name | Area of Analysis | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| 👩🏻‍⚕️ | Health analysis | I answer business questions related to patients data, such as average and median measurements per user, types of measurements for active users, and median blood pressure values for users. |  
| 👩🏻‍⚕️ Clustering analysis for CKD Patients | EDA, data prepreprocessing, ML modeling, survival analysis | Analyzed more than 8M+ healthcare claim data for chronic kidney disease(CKD) patients. Use random forest and survival analysis for feature selection, and applied Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering model that predicts the CKD progression which provided support to healthcare providers in providing personal level treatment|
